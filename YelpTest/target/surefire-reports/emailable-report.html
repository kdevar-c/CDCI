First to Review
This place is my favorite for a quick-grab pizza lunch!  Although the salad bar has nothing too fancy or out of the ordinary, it is always consistantly great &amp; the pizza is really great, too.  The buffet price is perfect.  They are good about keeping everything stocked -all the delicious salad, pizza, and pasta you can eat in a great little place!!!

They also have the same one waitress there, every time we go, and she is SO NICE and always gets your refill before you ask.  She makes me smile every time I see her...<br/>Customer Review 4 : 1/27/2017
i almost never give bad reviews because I try sympathizing as i&apos;ve worked in the service industry.

But this location was God awful. There was no buffet and they burned the pizza they made for me. Then still charged me $12 .. i really shouldnt have paid it but i certainly wont go back. Very poorly managed.<br/>Customer Review 6 : 2/19/2017
Don&apos;t know where the rancid taste came from (nauseating), but first time eating Pizza Inn and will not be getting food from there again.<br/>Customer Review 8 : 1/2/2016
Got delivery. They were about 45 min later than the one hour delivery window. very annoying

Pizza is decent. Nothing to write home about. Same with the garlic breadsticks.<br/>Customer Review 10 : 6/27/2015

I showed up with a craving for pizza. Namely a pizza buffet is what I had in mind. I spotted this Pizza Inn driving around and it was less than a mile from my home, so I made my mind to give it a go at some point.

Usually Pizza Inn can outdo Cici&apos;s in terms of quality, which is why it&apos;s slightly pricier.

Instead I walked in, immediately noticing that the very small and dimly lit establishment reeked of dust and odor, seemed grimy and filthy and that the buffet was reduced to a few sad slices of pizza that looked like they were there for hours. Really - for hours.

There was an employee on the phone who did not acknowledge my presence, and I made up my mind right there that I wasn&apos;t going to eat here.

Apparently the buffet had just closed right before I came in.

A buffet that closes at 2pm...yes, that&apos;s right. Not the normal standard for Pizza Inn, or any pizza buffet for that matter, and with a Cici&apos;s just a skip and a hop away serving at normal hours, I don&apos;t need to give this establishment my business, ever.

I turned on my heel and went to Angry Dog for lunch, where I was not disappointed.

In summary:

Service - Lacking.

Cleanliness - I felt like I needed a shower after walking in, much less would I trust the place to serving me food.

Selection - Horrible, if you can manage to make it in during prime lunch hours, that is.

What a complete disappointment of a Pizza Inn. I will not be back.
Pizza &quot;buffet&quot;.<br/>Customer Review 14 : 4/7/2014
Ordered over the phone using Groupon and the person that took my order was rude and abrasive while taking my order.  When the food arrived, the pizza was disgustingly undercooked and it is very apparent they skimp on the quality as well as the quantity of food.  

There is barely any cheese on the pizza, the toppings are sparse, and the mushrooms are canned mushrooms.  The wings were soggy and seemed like they were microwaved.  You could get better wings at Krogers.

On top of that they charged me gratuity for delivery.  I understand that there is a delivery charge and I&apos;m fine with that, but gratuity for delivery is BS.

AVOID THIS PLACE.  I skipped lunch and ordered from here for dinner.  After about 3 slices I lost my appetite.  It&apos;s THAT bad.

*EDIT - Both my girlfriend and I now have upset stomachs from the food.  I rarely give out negative reviews but this place is DISGUSTING.<br/>Customer Review 16 : 11/6/2013
I Have been a Fan of this Pizza Inn for years. They take real good care of you. How you doin and what would you like is what you hear when you walk in the door. It will become a habit..... Great pizza and beyond Great service<br/>Customer Review 18 : 3/6/2014
Don&apos;t know where to begin. No one was answering. When I finally got an answer the man on the phone, who said is the owner was very rude. No service whatsoever. Very demanding and spoke over me while I was ordering. Pizza came wrong. Salad was old. Tea tasted horrible. First and last time I try anything from here. Don&apos;t waste your money or time.<br/>Customer Review 20 : 11/6/2013

This is by far the best Pizza Inn in Texas! They are always super clean and always courteous. The staff is very accommodating and the food is always hot and fresh. I highly recommend going to this location even if you have to take a drive to get there. It is well worth the trip!<br/>Customer Review 22 : 2/19/2011
I am in medical sales and part of the job requires providing lunch to my accounts in Dallas area hospitals. I use Pizza Inn every time and it always goes down without a hitch. Connie, the owner, makes my life so easy. I call her and tell her how many people I&apos;m catering for and she does the rest...the order always arrives to the hospital ON TIME, hot and fresh and she takes care of all the details like napkins, soda and cups. She&apos;s a lifesaver because I just moved to TX for this job. She takes care of the food so I can concentrate on delivering a great presentation. The doctors and nurses always say the pizza is delicious! I agree.</div></td></tr></table><p class="totop"><a href="#summary">back to summary</a></p><h3 id="m1">com.yelptest.AppTest#Yelp_Test</h3><table class="result"><tr class="param"><th>Parameter #1</th><th>Parameter #2</th></tr><tr class="param stripe"><td>1</td><td>Order Pickup</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Messages</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div class="messages">Total no. of Search results: 2542<br/>1.

If you like chilaquiles verdes, you have to try this place! They were absolutely delicious. I cleaned my plate in a matter of minutes:-)

My hubby ordered the Cuban sandwich and fries and it was very tasty.

Located in a shopping strip center, it can easily go unnoticed. There is a small patio area that you can eat outside on a nice day.

Will definitely go back when I&apos;m in the area!!<br/>Customer Review 4 : 4/29/2017

OH MY GOODNESS!! This is truly a diamond in the rough! The food was absolutely exquisite and true to its name! It tasted like Latin food that I grew up eating. I&apos;m Mexican but they have a little bit of everything from different Latin cultures here. My dad used to take me to eat different laying food not just Mexican food and I can remember the tastes specifically, they hit the mark! It was hot inside but they have a little patio area that had a nice breeze and ambiance.

I got the chicken sandwich and my fiancé got the pulled chicken salad, we both took some of our dish to go and we had dessert. We had blueberry bread and a tres leches cupcake, both were amazing! It seems like the pastries are their strength so I definitely recommend their pastries. We will be going back for brunch very soon!

Located in an obscure shopping plaza, I&apos;ve never really given this place a second glance. A friend recently told me how good it is, so figured &quot;why not?&quot;

On the walk up I was pleasantly surprised to see in extended patio. Great it&apos;s a beautiful sunny day and I can enjoy my meal outside.

Even more surprising, was the fact that it was packed inside. This was around 1215 on Thursday. What I really loved was that they had a separate vegetarian menu in addition to an extended menu. All of their delicious pastries are on display... so credibly tempting, but I resisted.

Now onto the food:
- I opted for the vegetarian crepe and it was way more than what I was expecting. Smothered in a tomatillo sauce, the crate was light and spongy, with deliciously cooked veggies. I didn&apos;t realize that it would come with cheese on top and the most delicious, well seasoned potato wedges with a spicy aioli sauce on the side. Needless to say I left incredibly full and satisfied. I&apos;m already thinking about coming back for brunch on the weekend.

Ambiance:
- Man, do they move fast. With the amount of traffic that came through during the two hours that I was there, it was nonstop. We waited the expected amount of time for our food, and enjoyed the Cubano music outside on the patio. At one point I commented on how it felt as though I was on a resort.

Really glad that I discovered this local gem. Will definitely be back, sooner than probably later.<br/>Customer Review 8 : 3/6/2017
I happened to be in the area and now would drive here for the best hot sandwiches.

First time? Order the chicken sandwich. I did because it was rated so highly and it exceeded expectations. I added jalapeños. :)

Vibe is super cute and homely. Reminds me of Austin/local places. The desserts look amazing and the serving sizes are large.

Friendly service and cute patio outside as well.

Special mentions: they have a veggie menu. Tres leeches cupcakes!
Chicken sandwich! W jalapeños.<br/>Customer Review 10 : 6/8/2017

I&apos;ve been here twice and loved it every time. Only had the Cubano, it was so good the first time that it&apos;s all I order. Nice staff and the restaurant is clean and bright. It&apos;s kind of small, but has a really nice outdoor area.<br/>Customer Review 12 : 6/6/2017
Delicious hole in the wall. Food is filled with flavor but is greasy. My favorites are their chicken sandwich and their chicken chilaquiles<br/>Customer Review 14 : 5/28/2017
This place was so good. We stopped by after church. Super inviting. I got the best selling chicken sandwich. It comes with delicious homemade potatoes and a Latin mayo on the side. My husband got the chilaquiles verdes and a fresh squeezed mango lemonade. Everything was served timely, was hot and fresh AND most importantly, was extremely flavorful. We&apos;ll be back soon.<br/>Customer Review 16 : 3/18/2017

I continue to love this place. I had their &quot;best selling&quot; chicken sandwich which included small bits of richly seasoned chicken (generous serving) with melted cheese, mustard, lettuce and other condiments which slip my mind at the moment. The French fries are nicely seasoned and the serving size is just right.

A very satisfying meal at a crazy low price.

My only complaint, minimal at best, is that the tea could be a little stronger.<br/>Customer Review 18 : 11/20/2016
We loved this place! We were starving after the Susan G Komen race at Northpark a few weeks ago. One of our team mates yelped this place. It happened to be on my bookmarks, so we headed over!

They&apos;re super fast and friendly. The food was delicious and def helped us recharge for the rest of our weekend! See the pix! They don&apos;t lie!

What a delightful get away in a very unlikely location!!  PEOPLE,  YOU NEED TO COME HERE!!

I had seen the sign for quite a while, but never made it in.  I just couldn&apos;t imagine a place in that strip mall could be good.  WRONG assumption on my part!

I walked in through the outdoor seating area that looked like what you would find in a vacation resort.  I will have to return and eat outside in nicer weather!  

Walking in, the decorations everywhere and smiles on everyone told me quickly this is really a cheerful place.  The staff were all friendly, smiling and welcoming.  They cured a rough day at the office in a second. No alcohol required! I really felt special!

Fresh cut flowers on the table added a really special touch. Lots of cute sayings on the wall, My favorite was &quot;chocolate makes clothes shrink&quot; (or something like that). The decorations were really bright and friendly.

I actually ordered a couple of sandwiches to try as I couldn&apos;t decide on one.  That made for 2 delicious meals.  I had the Cubano and the Lomo Saltado and the flavors of both were wonderful! The fries were just like home made and tasted quite good. The dipping sauce was delicious (ask for 2). They had pastries and baked goods at the counter that made my hungry belly want to try more! I did try the pecan cookies and they made me smile.

Think of a non-alcoholic beverage, and I bet they had it. I could see actual flame as they cooked.  Flame kissed food is always the best!

They offered all types of healthy options, a great breakfast menu (which I will try) and that family run and cared for feel.  

Seriously, try this place.  You need a vacation from the usual.<br/>Customer Review 24 : 6/4/2017
Had the Cubano sandwich and fries as well as a tres leches cupcake. Everything was wonderful! I got it to go and it was all still hot and great when I got home. The cupcake was one of the best I&apos;ve ever had!<br/>Customer Review 26 : 1/29/2017

Great place for brunch! They had tons of choices. Vegetarian friendly as well. I did try their walnut banana bread and cafe con leche. Friends did order their chicken sandwich which very popular.
The place can get very busy as well. Will definitely come back and try some other entrees.<br/>Customer Review 28 : 7/13/2016

Here&apos;s the deal- I&apos;ve always been a fan HUGE fan of the food at Latin Deli, but let me be honest in telling you their consistency is lacking.  You can order two of the same menu items and one is slightly different than the other.  Or from one week to another notice differences in the menu items.  Take it all in stride because I haven&apos;t seen anything different from them yet.

Got two chicken sandwiches (no cheese on one of them) on Friday, 8/8 with fries well done, neither of the chicken sandwiches had cheese (not a huge deal), one sandwich had avocado the other none, one sandwich had lots of chicken for a full sandwich, the other one with the avocado had sparsely distributed chicken.    The jalapeños on the sandwich give it a great kick.  The fries were not well done, not even close.  Latin Deli has fries that are to die for, but I personally hate soggy fries.  Hands down one of the top three chicken sandwiches in Dallas.  You cannot go wrong with this choice!  The Latin Mayo here is delicious, and you can even dip your fries in it for a tasty twist.

The red chicken salad and the pulled chicken salad are delicious.  I favor the red chicken slightly more.

I haven&apos;t had their breakfast, but I&apos;m well overdue to try it because I hear it&apos;s equally as good as their lunch and dinner menu.  Also, try their coffee because it&apos;s well worth it.

Even with all their quirks and inconsistencies and slower service, I haven&apos;t found a great reason not to keep returning to Latin Deli.  Very cool food concepts, reasonable pricing, inconspicuous location, small dog friendly patio in front, and food that keeps you coming back for more.
Inside the restaurant<br/>Customer Review 30 : 4/23/2017
So I&apos;ve been to this place a handful of times over the years and it&apos;s been pretty consistent. Food is good and service is alright. Everytime I order from here, I&apos;m reminded of why I don&apos;t go more often.

The main problem with this place? Time management. Without fail, I always end up waiting for a long time for my order. Doesn&apos;t matter if I call in a hour before or if it&apos;s completely dead in the restaurant I always wait. This latest time was the worst though.

Me and my wife went around 11 on sunday and the place was packed so we expected a wait. Made our order and sat down. About an hour later, the rush has died down and still no food. People that came in after us got their orders. We hear the chef call out orders that aren&apos;t ours and we are like wtf. Simply put, they forgot us. If I hadn&apos;t said anything we would still be waiting for our food. They scramble for 5 minutes and poof our order appears. My wife&apos;s chiliqulies were fine, my Cuban was cold.

I get it, it was busy, I was expecting a wait. That&apos;s not an excuse to forget people sitting less than 7 feet way from you, people you have to pass by all the time to serve other people. And I see it happen to other customers too. I want to love this place but after all this time they still can&apos;t get their crap together and I&apos;m tired of it.<br/>Customer Review 32 : 3/18/2017

Nice comfortable Latin inspired cafe in NE Dallas Lakewood, White Rock area.  Menu has Cuban, Mexican, and Central American themed foods served simple, but with some gourmet flair.

Seating outside was good for a Spring day.

Food was cooked with quality and plenty of seasonings.

Came because of relaxed brunch reviews on Yelp.  It did not disappoint, although you should go dressed down and casual.  Very laid back.

Service was good and quick.

Would definitely visit again.<br/>Customer Review 34 : 4/26/2017
I went there for the first time expecting something quaintly South of the Border but it was just your basic modern deli. They seem to do a brisk take-out business but there&apos;s plenty of room to sit and eat.

I came because I heard they served Cubanos so I ordered one plus a mozzarella and tomate. The food is a bit labor-intensive so, due to orders ahead of me, it took a while to get my grub. (For those whom every minute counts I advise phoning ahead.) Both sandwiches were excellent and came with a side order of thick and tasty home fries.

The Latin Deli has definitely been added to my go-to list for out-of-the-ordinary knosh.<br/>Customer Review 36 : 12/29/2016

The Latin Deli is a small, feel-good vibe sandwich and bakery nook whose food will leave you satisfied. They have a colorful and simple decor and outdoor seating area. Much like their appearance, the Latin Deli&apos;s food is colorful, yet straightforward. Their ingredients are relatively simple and of good quality, but combined together they make for a delicious and affordable vibrant meal. The simplicity yet uniqueness of the restaurant and friendliness of the small staff makes for a homey and comfortable feel. They offer a variety of fruity drinks, sandwiches, crepes, breakfast options, coffee, and baked goods like tres leches cupcakes, chocolate flan, and some cookies.

On this particular occasion we got a tamarind and mango smoothie, a classic Mexican torta, a pineapple and pork sandwich, and a slice of mango flan.

The smoothie was a mix of the two fruits listed on their menu and it was made without complaint or up-charge. It was sweet with the taste of tamarind without being overpowering due to the mild taste of mango. I could not tell if the ingredients were fresh, but it tasted good all the same.

The pork and pineapple sandwich was stuffed with nice fatty pieces of hand pulled pork and slices of grilled ham and pineapple slices. The bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The only complaint would be to have slightly more pineapple to balance the heaviness of the meats.

The classic Mexican torta came with a variety of meats and chorizo, avocado, cheese, jalapeños, tomatoes and mayo. All together, the different tastes and saltinesses of the meats combined nicely with the avocado and mayonnaise. The jalapeños had a nice tart pickled flavor to help cut the meat while adding a nice mild spice to the taste.

Both sandwiches came with French fries that were wonderfully seasoned with what seemed like salt, a red pepper, and a little bit of sugar. On the side was a spicy mayo-like dipping sauce, however the fries were perfectly fine on their own. Another minor complaint was that the fries started to become soggy towards the end of our meal. Even so, I still ate them all... What can I say? I&apos;m fat.

As for the mango flan, it was more comparable to a very soft moist cake, rather than being gooey and pudding-like. This didn&apos;t detract from the flan at all, as the texture and flavor was perfectly fine. The flan was nicely laid out on a plate with some tres leches and little fruity sauce swirls; a nice touch. However, the mango flavor was not really to my liking. While in total the flan tasted good, I would have preferred it without the mango.

If you can&apos;t tell by the expansiveness of this review, I liked the Latin Deli. The food is good, the portions are healthy, and the meal, flan not included, came to a total of just around $20 at $8 a sandwich order. Just as much, the guy at the cashier was friendly and doubled as an attentive server. While we experienced some minor setbacks, for the price and quality of food, a visit to the Latin Deli will be well worth it.

I will definitely be back again soon. As of now, from only one visit, I can&apos;t give them a solid 5/5 just yet. For now, however, the Latin Deli gets an easy 4.0 to 4.5.
Mango tres leches. For such a simple-feeling place, the flan had a nice finishing touch on the presentation.

I&apos;m always in a hunt of good Chilaquiles and thanks to a friend of mine that knew my desire for chilaquiles told me about this small business called Latin Deli.

The name did not got my attention at first but as soon as I knew that make beets juice and carrot juice I said to my self my family and I have to try this place. We went Saturday morning and to my surprise the chilaquiles verdes were amazing no like my mom of course but better than any restaurant that I have eating in dallas...my wife had a sandwich, my daughter had French toast and my son just pancakes the food very good  and excellent presentation.

The juices were awesome the staff were very friendly and trust me we found a new spot for our weekends....thank you Latin Deli!!!</div></td></tr></table><p class="totop"><a href="#summary">back to summary</a></p></body></html>
